## About Me ðŸ‘‹
I am an enthusiastic Junior Software Developer with a background in software & hardware technical support. My background has enabled me to become an effective communicator in tech environments and develop valuable relationships when working in teams, as well establishing a strong foundation in troubleshooting and problem-solving. I recently completed the intensive Makers Software Development bootcamp gaining comprehensive training in coding and industry best practices. Iâ€™m a quick learner who is always eager to improve, which is why the challenge of venturing into the world of coding has been a positive and exciting experience for me."
